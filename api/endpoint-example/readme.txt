How to make the endpoint work
_____________________________

+ Host both of the files in this directory on your server

+ Fill out the information in the config file (the channel ID & API URL is pre-filled)
	+ Make a random, secure string to use as your secret code. This code is just to stop spam requests triggering the bot.
	+ Get your GroupMe Access Token from https://dev.groupme.com/

+ Send Seb the URL of your `groupme-endpoint.php` file (including the secret code, but NOT your access token)

+ Et voil√†! Now you spam @everyone and the message will be from your own account.
